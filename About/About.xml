	<description>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types of xenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.

Vanilla Races Expanded - Archon introduces a brand new, mysterious xenotype of dimension-travelling warriors. Inspired by the very similar race in Dungeons and Dragons universe, Archons inhabit the space between dimensions. Not much is known about them, as they are the first xenotype not actually created directly by humans. It is believed that Archons are a xenotype created by some Archotech from all the humans that remained on the transcendent worlds.

They excel in combat, and they despise everyone that isnâ€™t part of their xenotype. They speak a different language, talk about different things, wear archotech gear and use powerful psycasts that are exclusive to them. They are incredibly psychically-sensitive and have new abilities that enhance their psychic prowess.

This mod will introduce new archite genes, considering how archite-focused the xenotype is.</description>
