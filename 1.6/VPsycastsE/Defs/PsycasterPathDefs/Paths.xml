    <description>Transcendent psycaster path gives access to a number of new offensive psycasts that are meant to inflict pain in one way or another. By manipulating the psychic energy and shaping it into various types of projectiles, transcendent psycasters are capable of raining death at the cost of psychic entropy build up.</description>

    <tooltip>Utilising the connection to the unknown, transcendent psycasters are able to deliver pure destruction by channeling the distant engines of hatred and focusing their wrath on single living creatures. Their power gets further amplified with their psychic sensitivity, allowing transcendent casters to unleash devastation on everyone around them. The knowledge of the transcendent path is locked to those touched by the void gods.</tooltip>
